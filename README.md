# Github Repo Finder

This project provides a simple web UI that allows you to search for repositories on GitHub. You simply need to type in the keyword of the topic you are interested in and upon clicking the search button, you will be presented with relevant repositories. You only want to search for repos that are written in a certain programming language? Fret not, this UI is also equipped with a selection of programming languages you can choose from! On top of that, you can import all the searches done in a session by also a click of a button!

## What do you need to get started?

### 1. Install package manager

Install the following:

* Node 14.9
* Yarn 1.13

\* Note that the latest version might also work

### 2. Clone the project repo

1. Go to your local directory of your choice and open a terminal. (I used Gitbash)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/aishahsofea/YOUR-REPOSITORY`
3. Go into the folder: `cd YOUR-REPOSITORY`

### 3. Install node dependencies 

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies. This might take a few minutes.


### 4. Run app in the development mode

Run `yarn start` to open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.\
Now that the UI is displayed, you can start searching for any topics.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
